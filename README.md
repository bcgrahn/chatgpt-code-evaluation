# ChatGPT code evaluation
This study delves into CHATGPT's proficiency in producing Python code that aligns with the PEP 8 coding standard, Python's official coding style guide. It examines existing research on AI-generated code and outlines the experimentation process, which included generating code using CHATGPT, assessing it with Pylint, and performing an in-depth analysis, all facilitated by Python scripts and APIs.
These findings contribute to ongoing endeavors aimed at enhancing the reliability and safety of AI-generated code, underscoring the significance of prompt refinement and adherence to coding standards within AI code generation.
